# Cytomine Core

## Install

See our [Cytomine-bootstrap](https://github.com/cytomine/Cytomine-bootstrap) project to install it with Docker.
A branch `spring-core` has the modification to install the core in its spring version (v4).

>  **WARNING**: The current beta version does not support already existing dataset created from previous version. You can only create Cytomine instance with an empty dataset. 
> This will be supported in the final v4.0.0+.
